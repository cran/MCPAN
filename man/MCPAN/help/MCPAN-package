_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Multiple contrast tests and simultaneous confidence intervals
     using normal approximation, if individuals are randomly assigned
     to treatments in a oneway layout. If the variable of interest is
     dichotomous, the binom-methods can be used. If the variable of
     interest is the rate of tumours in long-term rodent
     carcinogenicity trials (without cause of death information), the
     poly3-methods can be used. The methods implemented in this package
     are NOT published in peer-reviewed journals so far.
