_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     In a placebo controlled clinical trial, patients with psoriasis
     were randomly assigned to a placebo group and three dose groups
     (50 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg). Variable of primary interest was the
     proportion of patients with marked improvement of psoriasis. This
     data.frame mimics how raw data could have been represented in a
     larger data frame.

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     A data frame with 137 observations on the following 2 variables.

     '_I_m_p_r_o_v_e_d' a factor with levels 'n',  'y', for "no" and "yes"

     '_T_r_e_a_t_m_e_n_t' a factor with levels 'Dose150',  'Dose50',  'Dose75', 
          'Placebo'

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     For illustrative purpose only. Number of successes recalculated
     from proportions presented in the publication, while the number of
     patients in group 'Dose50' was not exactly clear.
