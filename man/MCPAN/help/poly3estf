_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Poly-3- adjusted point and variance estimates for long term
     carcinogenicity data if data are given as a numeric time vector, a
     logical status vector and a factor containing a grouping variable

_U_s_a_g_e:

     poly3estf(time, status, tmax=NULL, f, method = "BP", k=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    time: a numeric vector of times of death of the individuals

  status: a logical (or numeric, consisting of 0,1 only) vector giving
          the tumour status at time of death of each individual, where
          TRUE (1) = tumour present, FALSE (0) = no tumour present  

    tmax: a single numeric value, the time of sacrifice in the trial,
          or the last last time of death, defaults to the maximal value
          observed in 'time' 

       f: a factor of the same length as 'time' 'status', giving the
          levels of a grouping variable in a one-way layout 

  method: a single charcter string, specifying the method for
          adjustment, with options: "BP" (Bailer Portier: assuming
          poly-3-adjusted rates are binomial variables), "BW" (Bieler,
          Williams: delta method as in Bieler-Williams (1993)) "ADD1"
          (as Bailer Portier, including an add1-adjustment on the raw
          tumour rates) "ADD2" (as Bailer Portier, including an
          add2-adjustment on the raw tumour rates following Agresti
          Caffo (2000) for binomials) 

       k: single numeric value, the adjustment parameter according to
          Bailer and Portier (1988), defaults to 3 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     For internal use.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list containing: 

      Y : a numeric vector, groupwise number of tumours

       n: a numeric vector, groupwise number of individuals

estimate: a numeric vector, groupwise poly-3-adjusted rates according
          to Bailer, Portier (1988)

  weight: a numeric vector of poly-3-adjusted weights 

    estp: a numeric vector, groupwise poly-3-adjusted rate (according
          to method)

    nadj: adjusted n (sum of weights)

    varp: a numeric vector, groupwise variance estimate (according to
          method)

  varcor: a numeric vector, groupwise variance estimate, if necessary
          corrected such that estimates of 0 can not occur

   names: a character vector, the levels of the grouping variable 'f' 

       k: a single numeric value, as input
