_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Function to summarize data of long term carcinogenicity trials in
     a text format. Data are assumed to consist of (1) a dichotomous
     variable,  defining whether the tumour of interest was present in
     an individual animal at time of death, and (2) a numeric variable
     containing the time of death of an individual animal, and (3) a
     grouping factor.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     poly3table(time, status, f, tumour = NULL, symbol = "*")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    time: a numeric vector, containing the time of death of an
          individual 

  status: a logical (or dichotomous categorical) vector 

       f: a factor, specifying treatment groups

  tumour: the value which 'status' obtains if a tumour is present in an
          individual at time of death  

  symbol: symbol to indicate presence of tumour in the text
          representation 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A named list, containing a character string for each group
