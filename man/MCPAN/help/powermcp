_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Approximative power calculation for multiple contrast tests, based
     on normal approximation.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     powermcp(TExpH1, alpha = 0.05, corrmatH1, alternative = "two.sided")

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  TExpH1: numeric vector: the expectation of the test statistics under
          the alternative 

   alpha: a single numeric value: alpha-level, defaults to 0.05 

corrmatH1: a numeric matrix, the correlation matrix of the
          teststatistics under the alternative, must have same
          dimensions as length of 'TExpH1'  

alternative: a single character string, specifying the alternative, one
          of "two.sided", "less", or "greater"  

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Any-pair-power is calcualted, the power of a
     Union-Intersection-Test.

     The probability, that any teststatistic exceeds the critical value
     is calculated from a central multivariate standard normal
     distribution. The appropriateness of the result strongly depends
     on the assumptions, that teststatistics are truely following a
     standard normal distributions, which might not be the case for
     small sample sizes.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A single numeric value, the approximative power.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):
